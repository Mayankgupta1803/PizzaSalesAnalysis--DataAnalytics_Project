# PizzaSalesAnalysis--DataAnalytics_Project 
Welcome to the "Pizzas Sales Analysis" repository!
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on analyzing pizza sales using Excel and SQL. The project aims to gain insights into the pizza sales data, identify trends, and make data-driven recommendations for improving business performance.

# Dataset
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing information about pizza sales. The dataset encompasses a wide range of variables. This rich dataset provides the foundation for conducting thorough analyses and extracting valuable insights.

# Project Structure
#### The project is organized into several key components:

+ Data Cleaning and Preparation: The initial step involves cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. This may include removing duplicates, handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting data in a consistent manner.

+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In this phase, various techniques are applied to explore and understand the dataset. Descriptive statistics, visualizations, and summary metrics are used to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. EDA helps in uncovering insights and forming hypotheses for further analysis.

+ SQL Queries: SQL queries are written to extract relevant information from the dataset and answer specific business questions. This may involve querying the database to retrieve data on top-selling pizzas, sales by location, customer demographics, or analyzing the impact of promotional offers on sales.

+ Data Visualization: Visualizations are created using Excel to present the findings in a clear and concise manner. Charts, graphs, and tables are used to communicate trends, patterns, and key insights derived from the analysis. Visualizations make it easier to understand complex information and support data-driven decision making.

+ Statistical Analysis: Statistical techniques may be employed to perform further analysis and hypothesis testing. This could involve using Excel functions or built-in statistical tools to calculate metrics such as average sales per day, identify significant differences between groups, or determine correlations between variables.

+ Business Recommendations: Based on the analysis results, actionable recommendations are provided to improve business performance. These recommendations could include strategies to optimize best-selling pizzas, target specific customer segments, introduce new promotional offers, or improve operations based on customer preferences.
